# Dice-Game
In this project, I have used HTML, CSS and Javascript to create a simple webpage which rolls 2 dice when we reload the page and based on the number on the dice, one of the 2 player wins. 

To play this dice game you will need 2 player and each player will choose their respective dice i.e. left dice or right dice and then reload the webpage. After reloading, the player whose dice have higher number wins.
