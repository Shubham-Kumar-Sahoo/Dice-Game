# Dice-Game
In this project, I have used HTML, CSS and Javascript to create a simple webpage which rolls 2 dice when we click the play button and based on the number on the dice, one of the 2 player wins. 

To play this dice game you will need 2 players and each player will choose their respective dice i.e. left dice or right dice and then click on "Click Here to Play". After clicking, the player whose dice have higher number wins.
